This is a github page for my repository of R code.

### Notes

My notes, as .R files, were getting very messy and it was hard to find anything I wanted to reference, so I am using Rmarkdown to make things more presentable.

* [Fundamentals](fundamentals.html) - basic features of the language, data types, etc.
* [Plotting](plotSummary.html) - the plotting systems with examples
* [Shapes](shapes.html) - Constructing data shapes, looking at data, cleaning data, dplyr, etc.
