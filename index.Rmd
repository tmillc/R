This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inverse<- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inverse<<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setInverse <- function(inverse) inverse<<- inverse
    getInverse <- function() inverse
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setInverse = setInverse,
         getInverse = getInverse)
}
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
