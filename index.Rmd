This is a github page for my repository of R code.

### Notes

My notes, as .R files, were getting very messy and it was hard to find anything I wanted to reference, so I am using Rmarkdown to make things more presentable.

[Here](2.html) experiments, tests in gh-pages

[Basic](basic.html) features of the language, data types, etc.

[Plotting](plotSummary.html)
